# computerSimulation
It's a project that delves into the realm of computer simulations. The simulation in this repository focuses on the division of random integers and measures the time it takes to perform this operation on a large scale.

## Files
- **main.py**: The core of the simulation resides in this file. It includes a function `sumIntegers(a, b)` that calculates the division of two random integers. The script then executes the simulation for a specified number of repetitions, measuring the time taken for each operation.

## Features
The main features of the application include:

- **Version I**: This is the initial version of the simulation, designed to explore and measure the efficiency of the integer division operation.

## How To Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and the following tools installed on it: [Git](https://git-scm.com). Follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bl33h/computerSimulation

# Open the project
